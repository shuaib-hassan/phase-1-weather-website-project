# **Weather-website-website-Project Completion Report**  

### The hosted link to this project is "  https://shuaib-hassan.github.io/phase-1-weather-website-project/ "

### **✅ Fully Completed Objectives**  

#### **1. Single-Page Application (SPA) with API Integration**  
✔ **Built a fully dynamic SPA** – No page reloads, all updates happen in real-time.  
✔ **Integrated OpenWeatherMap API** – Fetches and displays:  
   - Current temperature (°C/°F toggleable)  
   - Weather conditions (sunny, rainy, etc.)  
   - Humidity & wind speed  
   - 24-hour hourly forecast  

#### **2. Required Event Listeners (All Implemented)**  
✔ **Search Button** (`click` event) → Fetches weather for entered city.  
✔ **Enter Key** (`keydown` event) → Same as search button, but more intuitive.  
✔ **Unit Toggle** (`click` event) → Switches between Celsius & Fahrenheit.  
✔ **Geolocation Button** (`click` event) → Gets user’s location and fetches local weather.  

#### **3. Data Handling & Array Methods**  
✔ **Processed API data** using:  
   - `.slice()` → Extracted next 8 forecast intervals (24 hours).  
   - `.forEach()` → Dynamically rendered hourly forecast items.  
✔ **Error handling** → Alerts users if city isn’t found or API fails.  

#### **4. Code Quality & Best Practices**  
✔ **DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)** – Reused functions like `displayWeather()` efficiently.  
✔ **Responsive Design** – Works on mobile, tablet, and desktop.  
✔ **Clean Structure** – Separate functions for logic, events, and UI updates.

### **🚀 Bonus Features (Beyond Requirements)**  
- **Geolocation support** → "📍 Find Me" button for instant local weather.  
- **Dynamic weather icons** → Visuals change based on conditions.  
- **Time-based greetings** → "Good morning/afternoon/evening" display.

### **🔧 How It Works**  
1. **Search** → Type a city, hit **Enter** or click **Search**.  
2. **Toggle Units** → Switch between °C and °F anytime.  
3. **Auto-Locate** → Click **📍 Locate** to get weather where you are.  

*Note: Uses a free-tier API key—replace for production.*

### **💡 Why This Matters**  
This project proves I can:  
- **Build interactive web apps** with  JS.  
- **Work with real APIs** and handle live data.  
- **Structure clean, maintainable code**.  
- **Solve problems** (like unit conversion and error handling).  

**No frameworks—just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!**
